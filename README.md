# CaveApi
## In this project I'll be trying to create an `API` with vanilla `PHP` 
## To both strenthen my knowledge in `PHP` and to understand how `Routes` work in `LARAVEL`
### Navigating 
- All the styles are kept in the `/styles` folder mostly `SCSS`

- The logic handling the `ROUTES` and `RESPONSES` are found in `./control.php`

- `Disclaimer` : The data in `./data.json` was gotten from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`

### More updates coming soon
