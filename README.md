# CaveApi
## In this project I'll be trying to create an `CRUD-API` with vanilla `PHP` 
## To both strenthen my knowledge in `PHP` and to understand how `Routes` work in `LARAVEL`
### Navigating 
- All the styles are kept in the `/styles` folder mostly `SCSS`

- The logic handling the `ROUTES` and `RESPONSES` are found in `./control.php`

- `Disclaimer` : The data in `data/data.json` was gotten from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`
- `Disclaimer` : The data in `data/dogfacts.json` was gotten from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`

## The `ROUTE` handler now accepts an extra parameter to know the number of data to return
## API now sends data
## Added a 404 page for invalid routes
## `receiver.php` will receive and handle `POST` requests

### More updates coming soon
